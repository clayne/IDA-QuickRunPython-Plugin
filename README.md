# IDA-QuickRunPython
A small plugin for IDA that lets you quickly execute any python script.

# How to use
Copy or download the "quick_run_python.py" file and put it in your IDA Plugins folder. The first time you run the plugin it will generate a new file in the same directory called "quick_run_python_config.txt". Paste the full path of the python script that you want to run inside this file (without quotes). Now every time you use this plugin it will run that python file.

Use shortcut "Alt + R" to run it quicker.
